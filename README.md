## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- BEM

### What I learned

That you can use `width < 440px` in media queries instead of `max-width: 440px` which is easier to remember. Actually, I should probably do a mobile-first approach and use `min-width` or `>` instead. I'll do this in upcoming projects.

### Continued development

Looking forward to some more challenging projects.
